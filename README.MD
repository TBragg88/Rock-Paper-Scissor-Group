## Firebase Setup

To enable the real-time leaderboard on your own deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**  
   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. Give it a name and follow the setup instructions.

2. **Enable the Realtime Database:**

    - In your Firebase project dashboard, navigate to **Build > Realtime Database**.
    - Click **Create Database** and choose a location.
    - Start in **test mode** for development (you can update security rules later).

3. **Set Database Rules:**  
   For testing or development, set your database rules to allow public read and write access. In the **Rules** tab, replace the default rules with:

    ```json
    {
        "rules": {
            ".read": true,
            ".write": true
        }
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** These rules are insecure for production. For a live site, restrict access appropriately‚Äîsee the [Firebase Security Rules documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules) for guidance.

4. **Get Your Firebase Config:**

    - In the Firebase Console, go to **Project Settings > General**.
    - Under **Your apps**, select **Web app** (</>) and register your app if you haven't already.
    - Copy the Firebase configuration object (it looks like `apiKey`, `authDomain`, etc.).

5. **Update Your Project:**

    - Open `assets/javascript/index.js` in your project.
    - Find the `firebaseConfig` object and replace its contents with your own config from the previous step.

6. **Run the Game:**
    - Open `index.html` in your browser.
    - Play a game and submit a score to verify that the leaderboard updates in real time.

**That's it!** Your deployment will now use your own Firebase backend for the leaderboard. For additional customization or troubleshooting, refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/).

## üöÄ How AI Was Used

Artificial Intelligence was integral to the development of this project, enhancing productivity, creativity, and code quality across multiple stages. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at how AI contributed:

1. **Code Generation & Assistance:**  
   AI-powered tools like **GitHub Copilot** were used extensively to generate structured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Copilot provided context-aware code suggestions, boilerplate templates, and solutions to common programming challenges. Manual review and refinement ensured that the generated code met project standards and best practices.

2. **Debugging & Optimization:**  
   AI-assisted debugging tools helped identify and resolve errors quickly. For example, Copilot and other AI extensions suggested fixes for syntax issues, logic bugs, and performance bottlenecks. Additionally, tools like the **W3C Markup Validation Service** and **Lighthouse** were used to validate code quality, accessibility, and adherence to web standards.

3. **AI-Generated Imagery:**  
   All visual assets for the website were created using **DALL-E**, an AI image generation tool. This enabled the creation of consistent, Star Trek‚Äìthemed graphics and mockups, even without traditional design skills. The AI-generated images contributed to a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.

4. **Content Creation & Refinement:**  
   **GitHub Copilot** also assisted in drafting and refining written content throughout the project. From concise blurbs to detailed instructions and feature descriptions, Copilot provided real-time suggestions that improved clarity and cohesion. Most of the documentation and in-game text benefited from AI-driven editing and enhancement.

5. **Accessibility & Best Practices:**  
   AI tools like **Lighthouse** were used to audit accessibility features, such as color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels. Copilot further suggested improvements for semantic HTML and accessibility compliance, ensuring the site is usable by a wide range of users.

By leveraging AI at every stage‚Äîfrom code and content to design and accessibility‚Äîthe project achieved a higher level of polish, efficiency, and inclusivity than would have been possible otherwise.

## üåì Partial Integrations

-   **Dark/Light Mode Toggle Animation:**  
    More elaborate transitions were tested but replaced with a subtle, accessible toggle for a smoother experience.

These decisions were made to ensure the site remains approachable, fast, and easy to navigate for all users.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Considered But Not Included

During development, several features were thoughtfully explored and prototyped, but ultimately left out to preserve the site‚Äôs clarity, accessibility, and calming user experience. Here‚Äôs a more detailed look at these features and the reasons for their exclusion:

-   **Image Carousel:**  
     An interactive image carousel was initially designed for the hero or resource sections, intended to display rotating tips, affirmations, or Star Trek‚Äìthemed visuals. While visually engaging, user testing revealed that the motion and constant change could disrupt the site‚Äôs tranquil atmosphere and distract users who prefer a focused, supportive environment. To maintain a calm and accessible interface, the carousel was removed in favor of static, thoughtfully placed images.

-   **Breathing Animation:**  
     A guided breathing exercise animation was prototyped to help users manage stress or refocus between games. The animation featured expanding and contracting visuals with gentle prompts. However, it was omitted from the final release to keep the interface simple and avoid overwhelming first-time visitors with unexpected motion. The team may revisit this feature in future updates, potentially as an optional tool for users seeking relaxation techniques.

-   **Live Chat Widget:**  
     The idea of integrating a live chat widget for instant support or community interaction was considered. While this could enhance engagement, it was excluded to prioritize user privacy and reduce technical complexity, especially given the static nature of the site. Additionally, moderation and safeguarding user data would require significant resources. For now, support is provided through clear documentation and accessible design, with the possibility of asynchronous feedback channels in the future.

These decisions reflect a commitment to user-centered design, ensuring the site remains approachable, fast, and easy to navigate for all visitors.

### üé® CSS

Checked using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for standards compliance and cross-browser compatibility.

### ‚ö° JavaScript

Reviewed with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to catch syntax errors and enforce best practices.

### ‚ôø Accessibility & Performance

Audited with [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) for accessibility, performance, and best practices.

> **Result:**  
> No critical errors or warnings were reported by these tools, demonstrating a strong commitment to code quality, accessibility, and maintainability.
