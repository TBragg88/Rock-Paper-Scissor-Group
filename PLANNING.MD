**some ideas**
![Spock Character](assets/images/char-spok.png){ width="180" }

"Ahh, you chose rock. Predictable, yet flawed. For as science dictatesâ€¦ Spock vaporizes rock."

"Paper? A curious selection. It may refute rock, but against my intellectâ€¦ Spock disproves paper."

"Scissors. Sharp, but ultimately outmatched. You see, Spock smashes scissorsâ€”quite decisively, I might add."

"Ahh, the lizard. A most unfortunate choice. It is well documented that lizard poisons Spockâ€¦ but I anticipated this, and thus Spock prevails."

"You played Spock? Fascinating. A statistically sound decision. And yet, we find ourselves at an impasseâ€”Spock cannot defeat Spock. A true test of logic."

Planning Day 2:

gameboard: shift buttons and canvas: frame layout, header footer. translucent against a starry background* 


game difficulties: change red shirt to always winning diff, kirk being normal game and spock being impossible to win only drawn lose. 


star trek "space" colours: blacks blues navy colours.  like star print background, dark blues/greys bright highlights as "officer yellow" engineer "blue" 
fonts Orbitron, mychroma, Roboto
